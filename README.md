# Phase-III
Phase III of the project involves transforming platform-independent UML models (i.e., Design Class Diagrams) onto a platform-dependent implementation model using an OO language of your choice (e.g., Java, C++).  Such a transformation to a platform ideally overlaps with the development of UML models. Each time platform-independent models of a use case are completed, the implementation modeling on a platform starts. At this stage, UML modelers continue with the next use case.  The expectation is that the mapping of platform-independent models to platform-dependent models will reveal missing software components, including data structure abstractions, which are necessary to fully realize the requirements. Such information is then fed back to the platform-independent models to synch them with the implementation. This iterative and incremental process ends when all use cases are implemented.
